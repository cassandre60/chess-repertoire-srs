# Agent Operating Guidelines & Authority Hierarchy

## 0. Foundation context (read first)

This application is a **fork of Lichess Mobile** (GPL-3.0) rebuilt as a
**local-first chess repertoire + spaced-repetition trainer**. The previous
standalone implementation is archived at git tag `legacy/pre-reset` — it is
reference material only. Never resurrect old `lib/` code because class names
look familiar; the domain *contracts* are specified in the Markdown documents
and must be reimplemented cleanly inside the Lichess Mobile architecture.

Before doing anything in the codebase, read:
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` (layer boundaries, licensing constraints)
2. `CUT_PROPOSALS.md` (what Lichess functionality is removed/kept, and status)
3. `docs/INTEGRATION_MAP.md` (how Listudy/chessrs concepts are integrated)
4. `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root — the Lichess Mobile contributor guide
   (Riverpod 3.x patterns, Freezed, code generation, formatting, testing
   patterns). It remains authoritative for the foundation's conventions.

## 1. The Authority Hierarchy

```text
PRODUCT.md
    ↓ (product vision, user journeys, functional & UX requirements)
MVP.md
    ↓ (current active scope, included/excluded capabilities)
ARCHITECTURE.md
    ↓ (Lichess foundation, layer boundaries, licensing)
QUALITY.md
    ↓ (non-negotiable engineering, domain, performance invariants)
TEST_STRATEGY.md
    ↓ (how invariants are mechanically proven)
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
    ↓ (phases, tasks, execution status)
AGENTS.md  ← you are here
```

**Rule**: Code implements specifications. Code is not the specification. If
requirements or architectural boundaries change, update the authoritative
specification documents accordingly.

## 2. Development phases (beta-first)

The strategy is: **foundation → minimal vertical slice → beta → feedback →
refinement → additional modules**. See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the live
phase status. The owner is the beta tester. Do not gold-plate before the core
review loop is in the owner's hands.

Do NOT start Listudy/chessrs integration work until the foundation is stable
and the vertical slice exists (unless the task explicitly says otherwise).

## 3. The Development Loop

Every engineering task must follow:

```text
1. SELECT READY TASK from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (dependencies complete).
2. READ THE SPEC: PRODUCT/MVP/ARCHITECTURE/QUALITY sections that apply.
3. DEFINE A SMALL CONTRACT: testable, incremental brick.
4. WRITE TESTS with the contract (dart test, widget test, or integration
   test as appropriate).
5. IMPLEMENT minimally, following Lichess Mobile conventions (CLAUDE.md).
6. TARGETED VERIFICATION: run the specific test file — once, and on a budget
   (see §3.1). The owner's machine heats up under repeated local runs; every
   local run you skip is a run CI does for you on merge.
7. STATIC CHECK: `flutter analyze` on the files you touched.
   The full suite is CI's job — see the note on ./verify below. Do not run
   `./verify` as part of the inner loop.
8. RUNTIME VALIDATION (see §4) for anything user-visible.
9. FIX ROOT CAUSES; add permanent regression tests.
10. UPDATE IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md / spec docs if boundaries changed.
11. ATOMIC COMMIT matching repository conventions.
```

### 3.1 Local test budget (the machine is not a build server)

CI runs the full suite on every push. Local runs exist only to answer "does
my change do what I claim" — one answer, minimum heat:

- Iterate with `fvm flutter test <file> --plain-name '<test name>'`: one test,
  not the file. The full file runs exactly once, at the end.
- Never run neighbouring files, whole directories, or `./verify` locally to
  "be safe" — that safety is what the PR's CI run is for. If you have a
  concrete reason to suspect cross-file breakage, state it in the PR instead
  of running it.
- The fail-on-old-code check (stash + rerun) counts as the second run of the
  file: pass run + fail run, then stop. No third run.
- One `flutter analyze` per task, on the files touched, after the last edit —
  not after every edit.
- Never run two heavy commands at once (no test run beside build_runner, no
  parallel worktrees verifying simultaneously). The per-worktree
  `build_runner build` (~85s) is the one unavoidable cost; everything else is
  negotiable.
- `fvm flutter run -d linux` for runtime validation is exempt from the
  budget but stays bounded: launch, exercise, quit. No release builds, ever
  (§4).

### Isolation: one worktree per task, `main` only by merged PR

More than one agent works in this repository at a time. Each task gets its own
git worktree and its own branch, so no two agents share a working tree. `main`
is updated only by merging a PR that CI has passed — never pushed to directly.

```bash
# once per task, from anywhere
git worktree add ../chesssrs-<slug> -b <type>/<area>-<slug> origin/main
cd ../chesssrs-<slug>

# required before anything will compile: generated files are gitignored, so they
# are per-worktree. Without this every test fails with "No such file or directory"
# on a *.freezed.dart or *.g.dart import. ~85s.
fvm flutter pub get
fvm dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# ... work, stage BY NAME, commit, push
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create -R mansourvery-hub/chess-repertoire-srs

# after the PR is green and merged
git worktree remove ../chesssrs-<slug> && git worktree prune
```

Branch names are `<type>/<area>-<slug>` — `fix/review-redirects`,
`feat/design-tokens`. Not `agent1/…`: the branch should describe the change, so
it reads the same whoever picks it up.

**A docs-only PR gets no CI run at all, and that is deliberate.** The workflow's
`paths` filter lists what the job actually reads — `lib/`, `test/`, the build and
lint configuration, `assets/`, `scripts/` — and Markdown is not among them,
because no step in the job reads it. So for a change touching only `.md` files,
"CI is green" means *no checks were reported*, not *checks passed*. Say so in the
PR rather than leaving a reviewer to wonder whether it ran. If a docs change ever
does need a check, add a small dedicated workflow triggered on `**.md`; do not
widen the test job's filter just to make a doc edit look verified.

Four rules, each of which exists because breaking it has cost real work:

- **Never run a git command that writes outside your own worktree.** No
  `git -C <other-path> reset`, `checkout --`, `clean`, or `stash`. A `git reset
  --hard` or `git checkout -- .` in a *shared* tree silently destroys every
  uncommitted change another agent has made, and there is no undo for it:
  unstaged content is never written to the object store, so `git fsck` cannot
  recover it. This has happened here once already.
- **Never `git add -A`.** Stage by name. It is the same failure by another route,
  and it survives into a commit.
- **Never delete a worktree you did not create.** `git worktree list` first.
- **Check `git status` before and after anything that touches the tree**, so you
  can tell what you changed from what someone else changed.

Isolation makes conflicts *visible* — two agents editing one file become a merge
conflict instead of a silent overwrite. It does not make them *agree*. When two
tasks touch the same subsystem, say so before starting; the worktree will not
resolve a disagreement about what the code should do.

**Recovery is faster than prevention, but it is not guaranteed.** If another
agent's uncommitted work is at risk, it exists only in their working tree.
Commit early and often on your own branch, and take a filesystem snapshot if
you have one.


### Lichess Mobile conventions that always apply

- Riverpod 3.x (`.value`, not `valueOrNull`; no `ProviderListenable` type
  annotations). Prefer HTTP-layer mocking over provider overrides in tests.
- Freezed + fast_immutable_collections for data classes; generated files are
  never committed; run `dart run build_runner build` after model changes.
- `flutter analyze` on every edited file (including tests) — zero warnings.
- `dart format` every edited file (page width 100).
- Package imports, single quotes, strict-casts/inference/raw-types.
- Translations: hardcoded English first; l10n pipeline only after stability.

### Visual work

For anything touching layout, colour, typography, iconography, motion, or
component choice, follow `design/docs/` (see `design/README.md`), not Lichess
Mobile's visual conventions in the inherited `CLAUDE.md`. Lichess Mobile
conventions still apply to non-visual engineering practices (testing,
architecture, commit hygiene) inherited via `CLAUDE.md`.

Screenshot evidence is required for visual PRs (this was already the rule; it
now also applies against the design package): capture the affected screens at
phone, tablet and desktop widths, light and dark, and compare them against
`design/reference/index.html` shown at the same sizes/themes.

## 4. Runtime validation is mandatory

Past sessions produced green `./verify` runs while the real app had runtime
errors or looked nothing like the intended UI. Therefore, for every
user-visible milestone:

1. The suite is green — from CI, or `./verify` when working offline.
2. **Launch the real application** (Linux desktop or attached device) and
   manually exercise the affected feature.
3. Visually inspect the UI. For UI work, screenshot/runtime inspection is
   required — "tests pass" is not evidence of "visual pass".
4. Only then declare the milestone complete and record it in
   `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

Commands (FVM-pinned toolchain):

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build      # after model/codegen changes
fvm flutter analyze
fvm flutter test
fvm flutter run -d linux          # runtime validation
```

`./verify` runs `flutter analyze` followed by `flutter test` over the whole
suite — around 1400 tests, with no path filter. That saturates the machine
and takes minutes, so it is a **pre-push and milestone gate, not an
inner-loop step.**

- **Per change:** `flutter analyze` on the files you touched, plus the one
  test file covering the change. That is the loop.
- **Per push / before declaring a milestone:** let GitHub Actions do it. CI
  runs `flutter test` on every push and is the authority on whether the suite
  is green, so a local full-suite run before that push is duplicate work, not
  extra safety. Run `./verify` locally only when CI is unavailable or you
  specifically need the answer before pushing.

Say plainly in the commit message when a change was verified only by
targeted tests, so nobody mistakes it for a full-suite result.

**Release builds never run on a dev machine.** `flutter build appbundle/apk --release`
(R8 + native engines) OOM-killed a 15GB desktop mid-build, and Gradle's Groovy compiler cannot
run on that machine's Java 27 at all. Release artifacts come only from the `release-proof`
workflow on GitHub runners (dispatch it, or touch its file in a PR). Never attempt a local
release build to "prove" anything — the proof already has a home, and the crash it risks is the
owner's working machine, not a throwaway VM.

## 5. Quality gates and invariants

- `QUALITY.md` invariants are binding: pure domain layer, single chess
  representation (dartchess), local-first critical path, variation
  preservation, position identity, incremental persistence, deterministic
  clocks.
- `TEST_STRATEGY.md` defines the enforcement matrix; update it when the
  enforcement mechanism changes (not just when tests move).
- Old legacy tests (tag `legacy/pre-reset`) are *contract references*: mine
  them for intended behavior, then translate valuable cases into new tests.
  Never copy old tests that merely encode the old architecture.

## 6. Feature-creep policy

Default answer to new features is **no**. No achievements, gamification,
dashboards, social features, analytics, cloud sync, or accounts unless
explicitly justified by the product specs or later beta feedback (clustered
and reviewed first). When uncertain: prefer deleting unnecessary things.

## 7. Licensing discipline

- We are a GPL-3.0 fork: preserve `LICENSE`/`COPYING.md` and copyright
  notices whenever trimming Lichess code.
- chessrs (GPL): attribution if adapting; prefer reimplementation.
- listudy (AGPL): behavior only, never code.

## 8. Chess-domain references

When solving PGN-tree, repertoire-training, or SRS problems, inspect the
reference repositories first (see `docs/INTEGRATION_MAP.md` for what to take
and what to ignore):

- https://github.com/ZackMurry/chessrs (SRS scheduling, review queues)
- https://github.com/ArneVogel/listudy (study trees, training variations)

Do not invent a third architecture when proven behavior exists. Also check
Lichess Mobile's own `model/study/` and `model/common/node.dart` — the
foundation already contains study-tree and game-tree prior art.

## 9. Cut discipline (Phase 1 and beyond)

- Follow `CUT_PROPOSALS.md`; do not silently make controversial cuts.
- One subsystem per commit; after each cut: targeted tests + launch + smoke
  run. Run the full gate once at the end of a batch, not per cut.
- Trace dependencies before deleting: a removed feature may leave a reusable
  primitive (filter widget, avatar, sheet) that other survivors need.
- Keep GPL notices of any removed-origin code that still shares files.

## Lessons Learned

- [2026-09-25, Space Bunny Free] The full suite is a pre-push gate, not a
  per-commit one; this file used to mandate the opposite, and an agent following
  it saturated the machine on every change. Do not restore per-commit
  `./verify` without measuring it. Verified by: the owner reporting 100% CPU
  and full-speed fans after repeated full-suite runs.
- [2026-09-26, Space Bunny Free] A shared working tree is not survivable with more
  than one agent: `git reset --hard` run to sync with a squash-merge destroyed
  17 files of another agent's uncommitted work, ~10 of it recoverable from no ref
  at all. Unstaged content is never written to the object store, so `git fsck`
  cannot bring it back — recovery depends on editor history or a filesystem
  snapshot. Hence the worktree-per-task rule in §3. Verified by: `git status`
  going from 23 dirty files to 7, and by `git diff --quiet` against every branch
  showing the lost files identical to `main`.
- [2026-09-26, Space Bunny Free] A fresh worktree cannot run a single test until
  `dart run build_runner build` has run in it — `*.freezed.dart` and `*.g.dart`
  are gitignored, so codegen output is per-worktree, not shared. The symptom is a
  wall of `No such file or directory` on generated imports that looks like a
  broken checkout. Costs ~85s per new worktree. Verified by: `flutter test`
  failing in a new worktree, then passing after build_runner.
- [2026-09-26, Space Bunny Free] Audit's "High confidence" ratings do not
  predict whether a finding is a live defect in this fork. Of the findings
  checked line-by-line against upstream, five collapsed: M23 was 1 of 3 claims
  in scope, M4 was already fixed, H1's evidence was stale, M18 was not a defect
  (`ref.onDispose` fires on rebuild as well as on disposal, which is what clears
  the accumulator), and M17 was inherited unchanged *and* unreachable because
  nothing writes the table it reads. What correlated with a real, in-scope defect
  was file-level evidence pointing at fork-introduced code. Verified by: CI logs
  and `git diff upstream/main` on each claim before acting.

- [2026-09-26, Space Bunny Free] `makeTestProviderScope` stubs
  `preloadedDataProvider`, which is the only code that reads the stored token and
  fires `/api/token/test` on startup. So no app-level test can ever observe the
  token check: the request cannot be issued by anything. A test asserting it was
  skipped for days and blamed on a CI/machine difference; it failed identically
  locally. Before debugging a missing startup request, check whether the harness
  replaced the provider that makes it. Verified by: counting HTTP client
  constructions in the test — the app built one, for FCM, and none for the token
  check. Full account in `docs/audit-disposition.md`.
- [2026-09-27, Space Bunny Free] A test earns its place only if it fails when the
  code is **wrong**, not when it is merely **different**. The qualifying cases
  are: a defect just fixed, a contract that has already bitten us (44px targets,
  a tap actually reaching its row, a viewport not clipping its content), or an
  invariant in `QUALITY.md`. Of 18 tests added across the four settings
  reskin batches, 5 met that bar, 4 were reasonable, and 3 asserted only that a
  widget was absent -- so they would fail once the reskin deleted the type and
  would have to be deleted by hand. Mechanical renames get no per-item test: a
  reskin PR tests the defects it finds, not one assertion per file it converts.
  Verified by: removing the row count and the value text from the engine slider
  and watching both new tests fail, then pruning the three absent-type asserts
  and finding the suite unchanged.
- [2026-09-28, Space Bunny Free] Several review tests are load-sensitive and will
  flake in a large run, because `pumpAsync` waits a fixed 80ms of *real* time for
  the controller's database futures and then pumps the fake clock by fixed amounts.
  Under CPU contention less real work fits inside that window, so the controller has
  not reloaded when the assertions run and they fail on absent data. `flutter test`
  gives each file its own isolate, so this is timing and not shared state: the same
  four directories failed three tests on one run and passed all 128 on the next,
  unchanged. Before blaming a change for one of these, re-run the file alone, and
  expect a large parallel run to be the trigger. The real fix is polling on a
  condition instead of sleeping a fixed interval, across the shared helpers.
  Verified by: `review_controller_test.dart` failing inside a 128-test run and
  passing 30/30 in isolation, with `pumpAsync`'s `Future.delayed` as the only
  wall-clock wait in the path.
- [2026-09-29, Muse Spark] "Run the specific test file" is not a budget: across
  eight phone-feedback PRs the agent ran each file 3-5 times (new-test-only,
  full file, stash fail-check, neighbouring files, repeat analyzes), plus a
  62-test engine file and a 15-test account batch locally — all work CI repeats
  on every push anyway. The owner's PC heated up for zero extra safety. Hence
  §3.1: iterate with --plain-name, one full-file run at the end, fail-check
  counts as run two, neighbours and ./verify are CI's job. Verified by: the
  owner reporting the heat and asking for the rule, against a history of green
  CI runs that had already covered every locally re-run file.
- [2026-09-28, Space Bunny Free] `build_runner` writes `lib/l10n/*.dart` with
  different line wrapping than what is committed, so a fresh worktree shows 52
  files and ~38,000 changed lines that are pure formatting. Run
  `dart format lib/l10n/` after codegen and the diff disappears entirely.
  Do not commit the churn, and do not read a non-empty `git status` as real
  work: check whether `git diff lib/l10n/` is a formatting-only rewrite before
  concluding anything about what a worktree has changed. Verified by: 52 files
  / 13,844 insertions / 24,106 deletions before the format, empty after, with
  the test suite green either way.
