# Lichess sign-in: what was actually wrong, and how it was verified

Status: **resolved** 2026-10-02. Supersedes the "merged but unverified" version
of this file, which described a single outstanding check that turned out to be
five separate defects.

**Sign-in works.** Verified on Linux desktop against `lichess.org`: the owner
signed in through the browser, the session survived navigation, and a private
study imported (`GET /api/study/Gg4E2sIS.pgn → 200` in the app's `http_log`).

---

## Why this file exists

It was written on 2026-09-29 to stop the next agent re-spending a day on the
symptom *"We couldn't find any user by this name"*. That advice was correct and
is preserved below, but the conclusion it reached — that PR #94 was the only
thing standing between the app and a working sign-in — was wrong. It is kept
because the ruled-out list is what makes the next occurrence cheap to dismiss.

## The symptom, and what it was not

The app reported *"We couldn't find any user by this name"* for a real address,
while `curl https://lichess.org/api/player/autocomplete` returned accounts.

Ruled out on 2026-09-29, still true, do not re-investigate:

- `_emailRegExp`, `AuthRepository`, `AuthController` and
  `UserRepository.usernameExists` are **byte-identical to upstream**. The bug was
  never in them, and the repository was not modified in the ways that would have
  explained it.
- A widget test through the real `EmailLoginScreen` accepts the owner's address,
  so the address is not being mangled in transit.
- **No Lichess client accepts a password.** A "user + password" request is not
  implementable and must never be treated as a bug to fix.

## The five defects, in the order they had to be fixed

| # | Defect | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `kLichessHost` defaulted to `lichess.dev` (correct upstream, wrong for a consumer app), so a plain `fvm flutter run` sent `/auth/mobile-code/*` to the dev server | #124 — `lichess.org` by default; **no `--dart-define` needed any more** |
| 2 | The mobile-code endpoints were called with credentials in the POST body only; lila reads them from the query string | #123 — body first, retry with query parameters on 404 |
| 3 | `flutter_appauth` is Android/iOS-only, so there was no desktop sign-in path at all | #125 — loopback PKCE over a local `HttpServer` plus `url_launcher` |
| 4 | `authControllerProvider` was `autoDispose`, so the session died on navigation. Safe upstream only because cut subsystems (lobby, friends carousel) kept listeners alive | #126 — de-`autoDispose`d |
| 5 | Every WebSocket handshake was refused with `HTTP 400`: the `sri` query parameter was never sent | #129 — `queryParameters['sri'] = sri` |

Defects 1 and 5 are the ones that cost the most time, and both produced a
symptom pointing somewhere else entirely.

### Defect 5 in full, because it is the one that hides

The account menu's ping tile read `Offline` after a successful sign-in. It was
not the device being offline — `Connectivity` logged `isOnline: true` throughout.
The app's own `app_log` held the answer nobody was reading:

```
Socket|WARNING|WebSocket connection to /socket/v5 failed (for 2519s now),
retrying in 60000ms: WebSocketException: Connection to
'https://socket.lichess.org:0/socket/v5#' was not upgraded to websocket,
HTTP status code: 400
```

Lila identifies a socket by the `sri` query parameter and refuses the upgrade
without it. Confirmed against production with a standalone `dart:io`
`WebSocket.connect` probe: no `sri` → `400`; `?sri=<value>` → `101` and a pong.
The `User-Agent` is **not** read for this, in any format — upstream's own
`LichessMobile/… sri:x` agent string fails identically. This is inherited from
`lichess-org/mobile`, whose `connect()` is the same, so it never worked on any
platform.

Knock-on effect: cloud Stockfish evaluation and study sync had no live socket
for the entire life of the app.

## What "study sync" means here

Not editing studies inside the app. `StudyController.handleSocketEvent` handles
lila's `promote`, `deleteNode`, `anaMove`, `anaDrop` and `liking` topics — so it
is **live following of edits made to a study elsewhere**: you change the study
in a browser tab on lichess.org, or someone else does, and the app applies it to
the open tree while you are looking at it. Edits to a chapter you are *not*
viewing are ignored (`_isRemoteEditForCurrentChapter`). The app never writes to a
study.

This matters for C3: the app's relationship to a Lichess study is read and
import, never author.

## Still unverified

**Email-code sign-in on Android and iOS.** No device was attached during this
work, so the mobile path — defects 1 and 2 above — has never run against
production. Desktop uses OAuth and is verified. If a phone build is ever run,
that is the one remaining check, and the query-parameter fallback in #123 is what
it exercises.

## Regression coverage

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| mobile-code query-parameter fallback | `test/model/auth/auth_repository_test.dart` |
| session survives navigation | `test/model/auth/auth_controller_test.dart` |
| sri in the socket query string | `test/network/socket_test.dart` |

The sri case could not be gated: G05 judges a PR's test citations against the
**base** ref's `SPEC.md`, so no PR can introduce a new SPEC invariant. That
blocker, and a second bug where `gates.yml` omits `labeled` from its trigger
types (so adding `gate-approved` never re-runs the gate), are recorded in the
`GATES.md` escapes log.
