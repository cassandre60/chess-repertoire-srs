// The enforcement matrix in TEST_STRATEGY.md names a file for every invariant it claims to
// enforce. This checks those files exist.
//
// The failure this exists to prevent: an invariant recorded as enforced, pointing at a test
// that was renamed, moved, or deleted. The matrix keeps saying "Unit tests of the import
// pipeline" and nobody notices the tests are gone, because the sentence is prose and prose
// cannot be wrong. That is not a hypothetical — QUALITY.md 4.1 declared a 16ms bound for move
// validation for the whole life of this project with no test behind it, and the matrix had no
// row for it at all, so nothing in CI could have noticed.
//
// It checks the *target* column, not the whole document. The mechanism column legitimately
// names things that are not test files (`fvm flutter analyze`, `pubspec.yaml`), so the rule is
// deliberately narrow: any backticked path in the matrix must resolve. Inventing a way to parse
// "chess adapter" out of a prose cell would be a worse test than none.
